 * Factory method to create a new instance of a calendar subclass.<p>

 * properties:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>type</i> - specify the type of the calendar desired. The
 * list of valid values changes depending on which calendars are 
 * defined. When assembling your iliball.js, include those calendars 
 * you wish to use in your program or web page, and they will register 
 * themselves with this factory method. The "official", "gregorian",
 * and "julian" calendars are all included by default, as they are the
 * standard calendars for much of the world.
 * <li><i>locale</i> - some calendars vary depending on the locale.
 * For example, the "official" calendar transitions from a Julian-style
 * calendar to a Gregorian-style calendar on a different date for
 * each country, as the governments of those countries decided to
 * adopt the Gregorian calendar at different times. 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * If a locale is specified, but no type, then the calendar that is default for
 * the locale will be instantiated and returned. If neither the type nor
 * the locale are specified, then the calendar for the default locale will
 * be used. 
 *

 * undefined to use the default options
